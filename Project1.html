            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>My technical writing course in Fall of 2024 required me to create a resume, cover letter, and set of instructions. The final project for this course was to create a website to display all of these works in a digital portfolio.<br>This project was very useful in teaching me the important of a digital portofolio because while this one is a very beginner portfolio it will help me to develop my official one.</p>
